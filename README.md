## ModForge is a next‑generation, Android‑focused game management toolkit designed for competitive mobile players who demand consistency, control, and clarity. It provides a modular, profile‑based system for optimizing game performance and device behavior around specific titles, with an emphasis on online FPS games.

## What ModForge Does
ModForge lets players define and toggle “forged” profiles per game, combining performance tweaks, animation and UI adjustments, and device‑side optimizations into a single, easy switch. Each profile is built from modular rules (actions and targets) that can be safely applied, reverted, and shared, giving users fine‑grained control without manual scripting.

## Key Features
- Per‑game profiles for FPS, latency, and stability tuning  
- Modular rule system inspired by plugin architectures, supporting clean extension without touching core code  
- Clear risk‑level tagging so users understand which tweaks are conservative and which are experimental  
- Designed to integrate with modern Android tooling (e.g., Shizuku‑style elevated operations on compatible setups) while remaining usable on non‑rooted devices where possible  

## Vision
The goal of ModForge is to become a universal, platform‑agnostic “game command center” for mobile: one place to manage performance presets, device behavior, and safe client‑side tweaks, built by a competitive player for other serious players and developers.
